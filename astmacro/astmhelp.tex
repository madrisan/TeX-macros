  Next ``Lemma'' and ``Proof'' are an example of the two environments:

% (4) %%% PROCLAIM, PROOF, MATHNO and VEOP, BEOP %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Example: 
  \begin{proclaim}
      Lemma 1.1\\
      Let $v, w \in V$ be such that $w \in \gamma(v)$ holds almost everywhere in
      ${\Omega}$, where $\gamma:{{\rm I}\!{\rm R}} \to 2^{{{\rm I}\!{\rm R}}}$
      is a maximal monotone graph. Then
      $$
      \int_{\Omega} \nabla v \cdot \nabla w \geq 0.
      \mathno{1.1}
      $$

  \begin{proof}
      Proof\\
      Let $\mu > 0$ be arbitrary and note that 
      $w + \mu v \in (\mu {\cal I} + \gamma)(v)$.
      Then $v = (\mu {\cal I} + \gamma)^{-1} (w +\mu v)$.
      Since $(\mu {\cal I} + \gamma)^{-1}$ is Lipschitz continuous $\dots$
      $$
      \int_{\Omega} \nabla v \cdot \nabla (w + \mu v) =
      \int_{\Omega} \vert \nabla(w + \mu v)\vert^2
      \big((\mu {\cal I} + \gamma)^{-1}\big)^\prime (w + \mu v)  \geq 0. 
      \mathno{1.2}
      $$
      Letting $ \mu\searrow 0 $ in $\dots$
  \end{proof}

% (5) %%% SMALLSECTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{smallsection}
      Now the environment 
      {\tt\char92begin\lb smallsection\rb$\dots$\char92end\lb smallsection\rb}.\par
      This is quite useful for long quotations, and this paragraph is an 
      example of its use. 
      You can also use a {\tt\char92veop} (\veop)
      or a {\tt\char92beop} (\beop) to end your paragraphs.

% \topspace{7cm}{Figure 1}{The function $F(x)$}
